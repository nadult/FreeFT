## Introduction
FreeFT is an open-source, real-time, isometric action game engine
inspired by Fallout Tactics, a game from 2001 created by an Australian company,
Micro Forte.
 
Compiled binaries can be downloaded from SourceForge
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeft](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeft/files)

Note: master branch is currently unstable, because FreeFT is being updated to the latest version of libfwk.

## Building
To compile a linux environment with Clang 8.0 is recommended (G++ 9.0 or newer can also be used).
Following libraries/tools are required:

* libfwk (included as submodule):
	[https://github.com/nadult/libfwk](https://github.com/nadult/libfwk)  
    This library also depends on few other libs (SDL2, libogg, libvorbis, freetype2, libpng).

* zlib, OpenAL, mpg123, libzip, xxd, gzip:  
	These should be available in your distro's package repositories.

To build for windows, you have to cross-compile with MinGW.  
The easiest way is with MXE ([http://mxe.cc](http://mxe.cc)) with following flags:  

	export MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix
	export MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS=plugins/gcc9

## Running
To run this program, resources from original Fallout Tactics are required.
You can buy it on GOG or Steam.

FT has to be installed and resources converted with a convert program.
After instaling FT just run convert.exe. It might ask you to provide a
path to original Fallout Tactics. The conversion shouldn't take more than
a few minutes.  

To convert resources under linux, you can use this command:

	./convert -p "/home/user\_name/.wine/drive\_c/tactics/" all


## Basic controls in the game

* LMB on tile: move (shift: walk)
* LMB on entity: interact
* RMB: attack (shift: secondary attack)
* Middle mouse dragging: change view
* keypad + / -: change stance
* T key: teleport to cursor

Inventory (bottom left corner):

* up / down: select item
* up / down + CTRL: select item in container
* left / right: move item to / from container
* E key: equip / unequip selected item
